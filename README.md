 Click and drag while in Draw mode :
    Afilled-in Rectangle will display when you release the mouse. 
    The size will resemble based on mouse pressed and mouse released event.
    The filled-in Rectangle will display when after the mouse is released and wont displat while clicking and dragging
- Undo:
    The last drawn Rectangle will be removed when the undo button is used.
 - Redo:
     The last Removed Rectangle will be restored back when the redo button is used.(Undo was working perfectly fine but redo is breaking and while I was testing by adding
     syso I found that redo stack was empty and after some modifications both were working but not perfectly.I tried hard but I was short of time. Please do consider
     this time).
